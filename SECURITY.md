# Security Policy
## Supported Versions
Legacy-compatibility releases `v1.x`:

- :globe_with_meridians: We encourage using the [most recently released version](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js/releases/latest) from the `v1.x` release track before reporting an issue.

Future rewrites and feature tracks `v2.x`, `v3.x`, and  `v4.x`:
- :hourglass: Web3.js currently undergoes a complete refactoring and rewrite. At this time it is not recommended to use any of these release tracks, yet.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- :rotating_light: Please, send vulnerability reports to `security@chainsafe.io`.
- :warning: **Please do not file a public ticket** mentioning the vulnerability, as doing so could increase the likelihood of the vulnerability being exploited before a fix has been created, released and installed on the network.
